### Added
    * Docker Image that builds off of [aBarichello's godot-ci project](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci/) including the following additional tools:
        * dotnet sdk 6.0
        * dotnet-gitversion for version management
        * blender 3.6.0
        * helper scripts for stamping versions, installing additonal blender versions
        * helper tools for dealing with path disparity between GitLab and Github runners
    * A test project to verify the container builds as expected with a semi-automated pass/fail (still kinda needs visual confirmation)
